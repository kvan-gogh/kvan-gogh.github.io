Burnout only exists if you are pushing yourself too hard.  It’s a sign that you are not ready for that level yet. Don’t take a break entirely. Instead, bring it back a little bit. If you felt burnt out waking at 5 every morning, wake up at 7 instead. If you felt burnout going hard at the gym every morning, go less hard, but still go to the gym. It’s important to still do whatever it is you’re trying to make a habit of, even just going through the motions is fine. Once you’ve established a baseline routine, burnout will disappear. You don’t get burnout brushing your teeth everyday. Make your habit as automatic as brushing your teeth. Unfortunately, you can’t handle inspirational burnout this way. Burnout like making videos for YouTube, or writing a novel. Inspiration comes when it wants. Forcing that is what leads to burnout. What you should do, is everyday, make a routine of creating something random, in the same genre, that is unrelated to your important work. This way, the stakes are low, you can have fun doing it, and you can be certain to do it every day. In terms of writing, this would be like writing a random prompt everyday. In terms of drawing it would be drawing something you see every morning. In terms of video creation, you can make a video about a joke or something. Don’t worry about quality, no one sees this but you. This is more an expression of yourself, so everything is not pent up inside of you. Also, this way you make sure you regularly using the part of your brain. Inspiration happens in the background. A few days of not producing, and you will have a spurt of productivity. That is awesome, but that span of a few days without production is deadly. Without a routine, many people fall off or stop thinking about their work, or their skills may deteriorate. That is why the routine is important, to allow expression even when you have a block on your main work.
